For those seeking interactive information about expensive vs. affordable boroughs in London, including streets
(thanks to my overloaded leisure time, haha).
(should I create a Shiny app instead?)

Feel free to download the *.html file below & simply open it on your own browser:

The data was from the London Workplace Zone Classification (LWZC)
The UK Statistical GIS Boundary Files for London: GADM.
An interactive base map: Leaflet | Â©OpenStreetMap.

The categorization of 'Expensiveness' was established based on LWZC and my own interpretation (11-points Likert Scale).
I grouped the data frame by name and stated each group's dominant 'description'.
